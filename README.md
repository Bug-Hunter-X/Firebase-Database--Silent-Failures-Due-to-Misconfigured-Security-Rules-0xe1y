# Firebase Database Security Rule Debugging

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Firebase: silent failures caused by improperly configured database security rules.  The example code showcases a scenario where seemingly correct authentication fails due to overly restrictive or incorrect rules, leading to unexpected behavior and making debugging difficult.

## Problem
The provided `firebaseBug.js` file demonstrates code that attempts to write data to the Firebase Realtime Database.  However, if the security rules (`database.rules.json`) are incorrectly configured, the write operation fails silently, without providing clear error messages.  This makes identifying the root cause considerably harder.

## Solution
The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a solution. The correct security rules are shown, demonstrating the proper way to allow or restrict access based on authentication.  Additional logging and error handling are included to provide clearer feedback during development and help pinpoint any problems related to the rules.
