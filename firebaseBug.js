The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the database rules are too restrictive or incorrectly configured. This can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when dealing with security rules that are overly permissive or accidentally block legitimate operations.  For example, improperly configured rules might prevent writing data even if the authentication is correct, resulting in silent failures that are difficult to debug.
